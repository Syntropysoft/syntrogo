// Package testing provides testing utilities.
//
// Modules:
// - TinyTest: Simple testing API that mirrors app API
// - SmartMutator: Optimized mutation testing (8-30s)
//
// Philosophy:
// - Write tests like you write endpoints
// - Testing should be as simple as the framework itself
// - Mutation testing as a differentiator
